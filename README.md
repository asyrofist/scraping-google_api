# Everything a Digital Marketer Needs to Know About Data Collection through (Ethical) Web Scraping

As part of my post on web scraping from the Construct Digital blog, I have shared some code here that can get you started on your first data gathering project.

## Disclaimer
We are not endorsing scraping for unethical use, and this guide and code serves as a knowledge repository for marketeers who operate within the confines for PDPA and greater GDPR laws – which do not specifically cover web scraping but has implications for scrapers in terms of what they do with the data (selling, commercializing, reproducing, infringing). 

We are strong advocates of data protection and privacy. As a crash course, here is a refresher on our [PDPA vs GDPR article](https://www.constructdigital.com/blog/gdpr-and-pdpa-whats-the-difference). As a reminder, here are some major sites which explicitly tell you NOT to scrape their data:

•	eBay  
•	Facebook  
•	LinkedIn  
•	Taobao
